Linear Search is the most basic algorithm used to find an element in an array

Steps:
1. iterate through the array
2. check at each element if it is what you are looking for
3. if found element, break loop
4. else, move on to the next element

In the case of finding an element that does not exist in the array, linear search will iterate through the entire array

Worst case: look through the entire array of n elements - O(n) time

Best case: element is found at the first check - O(1) time
