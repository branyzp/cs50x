Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares 2 adjacent elements in an array and swaps them if the left element is greater in value than the right element,
then proceeds to the next element to the right and performs the check again on the right element and the adjacent left element.

Therefore, the subsequent swaps will lead to the highest value elements in the array "bubbling" to the right.

Steps:
1. Iterate through the array and check the first 2 elements
