If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I would categorize this listener's audio aura as being Purple as the listener listened to a lot of songs that were upbeat and very 'Pop culture'.
Most of these songs are reminiscent of the 100 hottest hits for a specific time period when they were released.



Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
This method of calculating the aura is very opinionated and utilizing data haphazardly. A better method to calculate the aura would be to interpret how the person was feeling by
analyzing the song lyrics, meaning and coming to a conclusion based on the overall vibe of the songs that the person listens to.
